The development of the Portfolio Website involved the use of several key technologies:

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** HTML was used to structure the content of the website, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS was utilized for styling and layout, allowing for the customization of fonts, colours, spacing, and overall visual design.
