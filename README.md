Project-1
**Project Title:** Portfolio Website Development

**Project Description:**
The Portfolio Website Development project aimed to create a personal website that showcases the skills, projects, and achievements of the individual. It serves as an online portfolio, providing a platform to display the creator's work and capabilities to potential employers, clients, and collaborators.

**Technologies Used:**
The development of the Portfolio Website involved the use of several key technologies:
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** HTML was used to structure the content of the website, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS was utilized for styling and layout, allowing for the customization of fonts, colours, spacing, and overall visual design.
**JavaScript (JS):** JavaScript was employed to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to the website. It enhanced user experience through features like smooth scrolling, form validation, and interactive elements.

The Portfolio Website contains the following:
**About Page:** Learn about the creator's passion for coding, artistic pursuits, and curiosity.
**Projects Page:** Explore a diverse range of projects developed by the creator
**Contact Page:** Easily get in touch via a user-friendly contact form and find social media links.
**Artworks Page:** A collection of creative artworks alongside technical skills.
