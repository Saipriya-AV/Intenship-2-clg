**Project Title:** Portfolio Website Development
<br><br>
**Project Description:**
<br>
The Portfolio Website Development project aimed to create a personal website that showcases the skills, projects, and achievements of the individual. It serves as an online portfolio, providing a platform to display the creator's work and capabilities to potential employers, clients, and collaborators.
<br><br>
**Technologies Used:**
<br>
The development of the Portfolio Website involved the use of several key technologies:
<br>
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** HTML was used to structure the content of the website, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
<br>
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS was utilized for styling and layout, allowing for the customization of fonts, colours, spacing, and overall visual design.
<br>
**JavaScript (JS):** JavaScript was employed to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to the website. It enhanced user experience through features like smooth scrolling, form validation, and interactive elements.
<br><br>
The Portfolio Website contains the following:
<br>
**About Page:** Learn about the creator's passion for coding, artistic pursuits, and curiosity.
<br>

<br>
**Contact Page:** Easily get in touch via a user-friendly contact form and find social media links.
